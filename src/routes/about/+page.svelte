	<h1>About me</h1>

	<p>
		Wowee describing oneself is hard. I'm just a dude getting into and out of <a href="/projects"
			>projects</a
		>. Graduated in the spring of 2024 with a masters in technology. I do engineering (whatever that
		is) for a living and develop games to live. Most of my endeavoirs worth writing about end up at
		<a href="/blog">my blog</a>, althought I make no promises.
