	<h1>About me</h1>

	<p>
		Wowee describing oneself is hard. I'm just a dude getting into and out of
		<a href="/projects">projects</a>, hopefully graduating with a masters in technology before
		summer 2024. I do engineering (whatever that is) for a living and develop games to live. Most of
		my endeavoirs worth writing about end up at <a href="/blog">my blog</a>, althought I make no
		promises.
