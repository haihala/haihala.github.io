# Teaching computer science

Full disclosure: I have no pedagogical background, for some reason people just
ask me to lecture about stuff. As for what I've done, I've been the main
organizer and lecturer at a summer program for high schoolers at
[Matematiikkalinja](https://matematiikkalinja.fi/). This includes lectures on
a wide array of computer science related topics like frontend web development and
command line usage. Practical exercises where the students make stuff are also
frequently used.

On top of that I've done some React workshops for already competent programmers
who want to expand their toolkit, as well as deliberate mentoring in work and
school projects. I have a lot of strong opinions about how both mentors and
mentees should act, but that's a post for another time.

## Tips for students

Fail. I'm being serious. You have no idea what you don't know, so try something,
anything, and fail. Success is a function of learning which is a function of failing.
Make pet projects, answer questions on help forums (even if you can't answer most
being asked there), participate in game jams, whatever floats your boat. Acknowledge
that failing can be scary but it's the only way and in the end you'll be better off.

As for materials, learning through passive participation like books, videos, and
unfortunately many university lectures can help, but it can also give you a false
sense of progress. The pages turn and your brain is gathering what you read, but
only through application of your knowledge can you be certain that you understand.
If you must, use passive resources in two ways. Way 1: Gain new perspective on something
you already know. Watching tutorials on stuff you think you know is suprisingly
insightful. Way 2: Reference. Reading documentation for some tool you use
cover to cover could techically help, but I find that you retain way more if
instead you go out and do a thing and when you don't know how to do something,
learn how to do that one specific thing and just that thing. Both of the ways may
require retreading ground. You may feel like you get something, only to really get
it the second time a few years down the line. This is fine and par for the course.

For way 2 I can't and won't offer sources, but for way 1 here are a few of my favourites:

- [The Art of Code - Dylan Beattie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U)
  - NDC presentation that I'm unable to do justice to with words
  - Fun, insightful, the prime example of perspective-giving way-2 source
  - **This is great for teachers as well**
- [Grug braied developer](https://grugbrain.dev/)
  - A brilliant meditation on simplicity and complexity
  - An ego check for some (that's me)
- [Parse, don't validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)
  - Consise yet comprehensive explanation of why more rigid type systems are powerful

And remember, engineering is not about memorization. It doesn't matter if you
have to google things or ask an AI. It's not a shame to not know,
what matters way more is if you can find out.

## Tips for teachers

Surprising to some, it's remarkably little about the details. People tend to
retain the broad strokes, but it's not feasible ask someone to listen to an hour
long speech and recall the details. Also usually equally surprising to these same
people, students are pack creatures who live off of vibes. Sliding a few jokes
in here and there as well as engaging them in dialog will do wonders. I find that
an hour writing jokes tends to yield better results than an hour tuning the
materials to be as correct as possible.

People also for the most part like sweets. I've used them as a reward for engagement
and while some do bite and others don't overall I'd say it's a success.

Public speaking skills also matter, but that's not something I have a massive amount
of wisdom for. Just shut your brain off and perform. Practicing before you have to
go out there sometimes helps, but over time becomes less necessary.
