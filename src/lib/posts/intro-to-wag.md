# WAG

"Whoops! All graplers" is the working title of the rust base fighting game
I've been hammering away for a few years. You can find the source code over at
[GitHub](https://github.com/rorawok/whoops-all-grapplers). The organization was
an attempt I made at some point to maintain a Jenkins server that would run CI
for some of my projects, however the server is long gone, I've just been too lazy
to remove the org from GitHub. I could write a manifesto on all the design that went into it
so far and in pieces and due time I probably will, but for now an introduction
will suffice. It's written in [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), a rust based ECS
game engine, uses 3D models I made and animated in [blender](https://www.blender.org/).

I noticed how I was essentially oscillating between two extremes.
I'd pick a super easy project, do half of it, lose motivation due to the
rest being trivial gruntwork, quit, pick a massive megaproject I'm more enthusiastic
about, get nowhere as it was way out of the scope of my ability, quit, repeat.
With WAG, I deliberately tried to aim for a middleground. Out of my comfort zone,
at least enough to be interesting, but also something I felt like I could tackle.
At the start of the project I knew very little rust, basically no blender, and
my game design experience had been a few microprojets, so traditional wisdom
would say it was outside of the scope of my abilities, which I would agree with
I also think this was the only way I'd ever get anywhere. I frequently feel pure
joy when something just works in a way I don't in my [pet projects](/blog/intro-to-pet-projects).
At the beginning I made a conscious choice. I knew this would take a while
(at the moment of writing we're about 2.5 years in), but that was going to be fine.
This acceptance allows me to keep at it, as I don't feel like a failure for not
getting it done already. The original naive plan was a year of dev time for a
prototype, but that's laughable in hindsight, especially with how the scope has
shifted. **This is fine**. My livelyhood doesn't depend on the success of the game,
which is probably for the best since there probably won't be much of that to go around.

The most important takeaway I've got from this project is learning to enjoy trying.
That comes with a fair amount of failing, but the learning mentality helps me get
past some humps. For more usable and less wishy-washy wisdom, I hope to fill the
bottom of this page with similar articles for you to enjoy.
