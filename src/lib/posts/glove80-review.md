## What and why

The [glove80](https://www.moergo.com/) is an ortholinear, column staggered,
ergonomic, split keyboard with concave key wells from MoErgo.

Picture from the manufacturer:

In layman's terms, two hunks of circuitry wrapped in plastic with buttons that
follow the curve of how your fingers naturally move. Postage included these
hunks will set you back about $400.

Two impulses lead to me owning one:

1. Desire to optimize
2. Minor wrist pain + anxious nature that enjoys future proofing everything

New toys also go brrt and my employer paid for it. I did pick it out.

I would like to highlight that the main reason was to optimize. I am from the
Nordic countries, which means the keyboard available to me throughout my youth
with all the keys I need to communicate in my native language are not exactly
optimal for programming. Some of the most notable annoyances:

- `$`, `{}`, and `[]` for need a separate modifier
- Tilde(~), carat(^) and backticks(`) are behind a modifier and require a chord
  - Buttons are used for accents like ã, â and á
  - To get a tilde, you need to put a space behind it
    - `a => à
    - \`(space)a => `a

At the intersection of my minor wrist pain and desire to optimize lies the
repeated wrist motions to access keys like backspace and enter. I would prefer
to not go back and forth to access those.

And to be utterly clear, I don't experience constant, significant, or
debilitating pain. I am somewhat sore at times and would still like to have
functional wrists in ten years, so I'm getting ahead of this.

## How it went

Ordered my glove80 which came with a carrying case. Initially I thought the case
was sleek and nice, but after a while I realized it obscures the fact that the
only reasonable way to move the damn thing is to pack it up in the carry case.
The halves are awkwardly shaped and not too sturdy so throwing it in a backpack
seems unwise. The case is nice, but I would like to be able to move my keyboard
without a suitcase sized carry case.

The difficulty of carrying is likely related to how many keys there are (80, 40
per half, 6 of which are in each thumb cluster). I adore the big thumb clusters,
as they essentially eliminate the wrist movements. This was what made me pick
the glove80 over ZSA offerings like the voyager (two thumb cluster keys per
side) or the Moonlander (four thumb cluster keys per side).

My needs for optimizing were met, albeit it was laborious. I got the
configuration software to do everything I wanted it to do eventually, but some
things like a dedicated key for backticks took some thinking (ended up doing a
multi-key macro). You can use ZMK and build it yourself, which allows you to
store your configuration in a git repo. I will probably do this from now on.

A few years ago I had tried Dvorak due to the need to optimize, but it came with
a bunch of problems. Almost every time I played a game, I needed to rebind all
of the keys. That was, if the game even allowed for it. If I used someone else's
computer, I granny typed with my index fingers. Eventually I gave up, but formed
a theory that the benefits of Dvorak could be achieved via other means, which
would give the speed and comfort benefits without the problems. My current
layout seems to validate that theory. The learning curve was notably better as
well, but my earlier experimentation may have helped with that.

On the topic of gaming, the glove80 is somewhat cumbersome in fps games. The
keys one is supposed to use with the middle and the ring finger are deeper
within the key wells. This is quite comfortable when typing, but not the best
when using wasd to move. I added a layer that shifted everything to the right by
one space, but this then had problems with what keys were available. Reaching T
with your right hand is trivial under normal circumstances, but if everything is
shifted to the right by a step, it jumps to the other half. After a while, I
just settled to having a separate gaming keyboard. Unlike with Dvorak, I have no
problems switching back and forth.

My major complaints have to do with minor physical traits. The feet of the
keyboard seem to have very little traction, so after a while the keyboard tends
to drift around my table. Not only do I need to readjust it, the pads at the
bottom of the feet are glued on and they aren't glued on that well, so in six
months I've had to replace maybe four or five of them. On a related note, I have
no idea who designed the tenting solution, but it does not work for me. Every
time I tried, I ended up with a fragile wobbly configuration and after a few
days went back to the flat configuration.

## Overall verdict

In short, I would say it does the bare minimum. It works. It fills my
configuration needs, but I do think I may have been more satisfied with one of
the ZSA options I considered. If there was a smaller ergo keyboard with 4-5+
thumb cluster keys I would seriously consider switching to it.
