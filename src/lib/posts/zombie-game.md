# So I got baited to make a zombie game with Pixi.js

[Link to game](/zombie-game)

Tried out [pixi.js](https://pixijs.com) because a friend of mine
piqued my interest in it and oh boy do I have some opinions.
Some of this is due to trying to insert pixi.js into my svelte blog, but I find
it also fails on its own merits.
