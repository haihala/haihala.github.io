\section*{CV - Eero Häihälä}
Printer friendly version

\cvheader{face-bw}{
    Insert a borderline narcissistic gloating blurb of text that has been ran
    through a thesaurus seven times to sound smart. Ideally it should assure
    the reader of my abilities in various circumstances with the slight caveat
    of proving nothing. 

    \vspace{10pt}

    I've gone to school for programming and professionally worked as a programmer.
    You can read more about that on
    \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/eero-haihala/}{linkedin}. I'd like to
    work in games. See \href{https://haihala.github.io/portfolio}{my portfolio}
    for some highlights of what I've done so far.

What I mean by each level:

\begin{etaremune}
    \item I'm as confident in this as I can be. I've worked with these for 5+ years and understand them deeply.
    \item What I think of as basic competence, but others keep telling me is a high bar. For most of these I have years.
    \item A week of (re-)learning away from a higher grade. I have previous experience with these.
\end{etaremune}

There are a lot skills I dabble in that didn't make the cut. I've hit the 50 skill limit on
